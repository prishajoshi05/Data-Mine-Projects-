    "Working with the flights dataset was one of the most enjoyable experiences during The Data Mine. The dataset, which focused on flight delays, provided a practical and relatable context, as delays are a common topic of interest in travel and logistics. Its rich features, such as departure and arrival times, delay durations, airlines, and states of origin, offered diverse opportunities for analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the questions I enjoyed was identifying the flight with the most significant delay. Using the `subset()` function, I filtered the dataset to focus on rows that met specific conditions. This allowed me to quickly isolate extreme delays and examine their characteristics. Another engaging task was calculating the average delay for flights originating from each state. For this, I used the `tapply()` function to group delay durations by state and compute the mean for each group. This method was both straightforward and powerful for summarizing the data. The tapply function was my favourite because it was easy , helpful and fun to perform!\n"
